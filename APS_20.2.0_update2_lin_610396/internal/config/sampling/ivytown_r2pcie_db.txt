R2PCIe	0x1	0x0	UNC_R2_CLOCKTICKS	Counts the number of uclks in the R2PCIe uclk domain.  This could be slightly different than the count in the Ubox because of enable/freeze delays.  However, because the R2PCIe is close to the Ubox, they generally should not diverge by more than a handful of cycles.	0,1,2,3	0x53	na	0
