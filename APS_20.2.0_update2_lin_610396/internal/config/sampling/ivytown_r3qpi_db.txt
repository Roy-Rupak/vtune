UNIT	CODE	UMASK	NAME	DESCRIPTION	COUNTER	OTHER	FILTER	INTERNAL
R3QPI	0x1	0x0	UNC_R3_CLOCKTICKS	Counts the number of uclks in the QPI uclk domain.  This could be slightly different than the count in the Ubox because of enable/freeze delays.  However, because the QPI Agent is close to the Ubox, they generally should not diverge by more than a handful of cycles.	0,1,2	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x10	0x1	UNC_R3_RxR_CYCLES_NE.HOM	Counts the number of cycles when the QPI Ingress is not empty.  This tracks one of the three rings that are used by the QPI agent.  This can be used in conjunction with the QPI Ingress Occupancy Accumulator event in order to calculate average queue occupancy.  Multiple ingress buffers can be tracked at a given time using multiple counters.; HOM Ingress Queue	0,1	0x53	na	0

R3QPI	0x31	0x0	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDIT_CYCLES_OUT	Number of QPI uclk cycles when the transmitted has no VNA credits available and therefore cannot send any requests on this channel.  Note that this does not mean that no flits can be transmitted, as those holding VN0 credits will still (potentially) be able to transmit.  Generally it is the goal of the uncore that VNA credits should not run out, as this can substantially throttle back useful QPI bandwidth.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x32	0x0	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDIT_CYCLES_USED	Number of QPI uclk cycles with one or more VNA credits in use.  This event can be used in conjunction with the VNA In-Use Accumulator to calculate the average number of used VNA credits.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x33	0x0	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_ACQUIRED	Number of QPI VNA Credit acquisitions.  This event can be used in conjunction with the VNA In-Use Accumulator to calculate the average lifetime of a credit holder.  VNA credits are used by all message classes in order to communicate across QPI.  If a packet is unable to acquire credits, it will then attempt to use credts from the VN0 pool.  Note that a single packet may require multiple flit buffers (i.e. when data is being transfered).  Therefore, this event will increment by the number of credits acquired in each cycle.  Filtering based on message class is not provided.  One can count the number of packets transfered in a given message class using an qfclk event.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x33	0x1	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_ACQUIRED.AD	Number of QPI VNA Credit acquisitions.  This event can be used in conjunction with the VNA In-Use Accumulator to calculate the average lifetime of a credit holder.  VNA credits are used by all message classes in order to communicate across QPI.  If a packet is unable to acquire credits, it will then attempt to use credts from the VN0 pool.  Note that a single packet may require multiple flit buffers (i.e. when data is being transfered).  Therefore, this event will increment by the number of credits acquired in each cycle.  Filtering based on message class is not provided.  One can count the number of packets transfered in a given message class using an qfclk event.; Filter for the Home (HOM) message class.  HOM is generally used to send requests, request responses, and snoop responses.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x33	0x4	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_ACQUIRED.BL	Number of QPI VNA Credit acquisitions.

HOM is generally used to send requests, request responses, and snoop responses.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x34	0x1	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_REJECT.HOM	Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected because the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).  It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.; Filter for the Home (HOM) message class.  HOM is generally used to send requests, request responses, and snoop responses.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x34	0x10	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_REJECT.NCB	Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected because the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).

Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.; Filter for Non-Coherent Broadcast (NCB).  NCB is generally used to transmit data without coherency.  For example, non-coherent read data returns.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x34	0x2	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_REJECT.SNP	Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected because the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).

Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.; Filter for Snoop (SNP) message class.  SNP is used for outgoing snoops.  Note that snoop responses flow on the HOM message class.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x34	0x20	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_REJECT.NCS	Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected because the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).

Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.

R3QPI	0x34	0x4	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_REJECT.NDR	Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected because the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).  It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.; NDR packets are used to transmit a variety of protocol flits including grants and completions (CMP).	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x34	0x8	UNC_R3_VNA_CREDITS_REJECT.DRS	Number of attempted VNA credit acquisitions that were rejected because the VNA credit pool was full (or almost full).  It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.; Filter for Data Response (DRS).  DRS is generally used to transmit data with coherency.  For example, remote reads and writes, or cache to cache transfers will transmit their data using DRS.	0,1	0x53	na	0
R3QPI	0x36	0x1	UNC_R3_VN0_CREDITS_USED.HOM	Number of times a VN0 credit was used on the DRS message channel.  In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.; Filter for the Home (HOM) message class.  HOM is generally used to send requests, request responses, and snoop responses.	0,1	0x53	na	0
